	\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
		\section{Background of the Study}
			% TODO: Background of the Study
			Machine learning (ML) is vast---it is used in different situations such as spam detectors, web search engines, photo tagging applications and game development \autocite{sharmaMachineLearningApplications2016}.
			There have been researches that are aimed at improving the implementation of ML in various games.
			A category of games under investigation through ML is the set of \mnk\ games, comprised of games where there is an $m \times n$ grid and two players alternate turns trying to earn $k$ pieces adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically or diagonally \autocite{hayesDevelopingMemoryEfficient2016}.
			Among the most common examples of \mnkpl\ are G\=o, Othello, and Chess.
			\ttt, the game under investigation in this study, is an example of an \mnk.
			A \ttt\ board is composed of three rows and three columns, and requires three adjacent pieces of the same player to render a win, thus it is considered to have a $3, 3, 3$ configuration.

			Improvements in ML have lead to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) players that can beat even the most competitive human players around the world.
			Machine learning methods (MLMs) are algorithms where machines are not explicitly programmed to do what is tasked.
			Rather, similar to its namesake, MLM-trained machines are capable of performing tasks given its own internal code without any human interference.
			In short, the machine \textit{learns} \autocite{geeksforgeeksMachineLearning}.
			An example of an MLM is the genetic algorithm (GA).

			This study aims to develop multiple GAs with different elite preservation methods and compare their performance in \ttt\ based on the possible situations.

		\section{Objectives of the Study}
			\subsection{General Objective}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item To compare the effectiveness of trained genetic algorithm (GA) organisms among each other as applied to \ttt
				\end{itemize}
			\subsection{Specific Objectives}
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item To implement known heuristics into Python code
					\item To train organisms of an implemented GA using different move generators (MGs)
					\item To compare the development of the performance of trained GA organisms among each other within 500 generations
				\end{enumerate}

		\section{Significance of the Study}
			% TODO: Significance of the Study
			This study will contribute to the body of knowledge in ML.
			Through this study, more can be known about how information gained from one method of AI can be passed on to another mechanism of AI through training.
			This will shed light on how information from one AI player can be transmitted to an MLM such as GA.
			This, by extension, can improve the comprehension of how machines can learn strategies in games from one with greater skill.

		\section{Scope and Limitations of the Study}
			% TODO: Scope and Limitations of the Study
			\textquote[\cite{askmediagroupWhatAreScope2020}][.]{When identifying the scope, you need to address not only the problem or issue that you want to study but the population that you want to examine}. Remember to narrow your scope down as much as possible to ensure efficiency and accuracy during the execution of the research.

			\enquote{%
				There are numerous limitations that can impact your ability to complete quality research.
				Research limitations may be methodological (related to how the study is completed) or a lack of researcher resources (such as time and research funds).%
			}
			Methodological limitations concerns the sample of the study and the efficiency of past techniques. This may include the size and diversity of the sample as well as the amount of research previously done that you can base your methods on.
			Researcher-related limitations include time, budget and physical constraints, as well as personal biases that might impact the flow of the research \autocite{askmediagroupWhatAreScope2020}.

	\chapter{REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE}
		% TODO: Review of Related Literature
		\textcite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019} lists five (5) important steps in writing an effective literature review: \textbf{Search} for relevant literature, \textbf{evaluate} sources, \textbf{identify} themes, debates and gaps, \textbf{outline} the structure, and \textbf{write} the literature review itself.

		\section*{Searching for Relevant Literature}
			\textcite{hardyGuidesLiteratureReview2020} provides a proper guide for searching effectively for a literature review.
			The following ideas are abridged versions of the common search techniques employed when writing an effective literature review.
			To begin searching, one must perform an analysis of the research topic.
			This analysis must tackle the main ideas and synonyms, related words and phrases, and concepts and ideas already covered about the research topic.
			In modern search engines, keywords exist to make searches more efficient such as: \textbf{OR} for synonymous terms, \textbf{AND} for joining words that make up the main ideas, and \textbf{NOT} for exclusion of irrelevant terms \autocite{hardyGuidesLiteratureReview2020}.

			\textcite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019} lists the following databases that might aid in the search for related literature:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Google Scholar (\url{https://scholar.google.com/})
				\item JSTOR (\url{https://www.jstor.org/})
				\item EBSCO (\url{https://www.ebsco.com/products/research-databases})
				\item Project Muse for humanities and social sciences (\url{http://muse.jhu.edu/})
				\item Medline for life sciences and biomedicine (\url{https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline.html})
				\item EconLit for economics (\url{https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/})
				\item Inspec for physics, engineering and computer science (\url{https://www.theiet.org/publishing/inspec/})
			\end{itemize}
			The importance of a proper abstract is highlighted during the search for related literature, as the abstract of a work will assist future researchers in selecting the work if they find the abstract to be relevant with their own research \autocite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019}.

		\section*{Evaluating and Selecting Sources}
			\textcite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019} emphasizes the fact that one cannot read and digest every single work written about the research topic, therefore each source should be evaluated to filter out the most relevant sources for the study.
			\textcite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019} further writes:\\
			\enquote{%
				For each publication, ask yourself:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item What question or problem is the author addressing?
					\item What are the key concepts and how are they defined?
					\item What are the key theories, models and methods? Does the research use established frameworks or take an innovative approach?
					\item What are the results and conclusions of the study?
					\item How does the publication relate to other literature in the field? Does it confirm, add to, or challenge established knowledge?
					\item How does the publication contribute to your understanding of the topic? What are its key insights and arguments?
					\item What are the strengths and weaknesses of the research?
				\end{itemize}

				Make sure the sources you use are credible, and make sure you read any landmark studies and major theories in your field of research.

				The scope of your review will depend on your topic and discipline: in the sciences you usually only review recent literature, but in the humanities you might take a long historical perspective (for example, to trace how a concept has changed in meaning over time).%
			}

			The need to take notes and keep track of sources is stressed by \textcite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019} by mentioning plagiarism.
			Plagiarism is defined by \textcite{merriam-websterDefinitionPlagiarizing} as \enquote{[the act of] steal[ing] and pass[ing] off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own : us[ing] (another's production) without crediting the source}.
			Such an act is frowned upon in the academic field, and must be avoided as much as possible.

			One may use bibliography management software to keep notes and source information that might be valuable later on in paper writing.
			Notes that are attached to a bibliographic entry in a bibliography management software can save time later on when one must remember the details of the source listed.
			Modern bibliography management software such as \textbf{Zotero} (\url{https://www.zotero.org/}) and \textbf{Mendeley} (\url{https://www.mendeley.com/}) usually have the capability to maintain and track sources and said notes with the addition of producing citations and bibliographies as well as files for paper-writing software such as \LaTeX.

		\section*{Identifying Themes, Debates, and Gaps}
			\textquote[\cite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019}]{%
				To begin organizing your literature review’s argument and structure, you need to understand the connections and relationships between the sources you’ve read. Based on your reading and notes, you can look for:

				\begin{itemize}
					\item Trends and patterns (in theory, method or results): do certain approaches become more or less popular over time?
					\item Themes: what questions or concepts recur across the literature?
					\item Debates, conflicts and contradictions: where do sources disagree?
					\item Pivotal publications: are there any influential theories or studies that changed the direction of the field?
					\item Gaps: what is missing from the literature? Are there weaknesses that need to be addressed?
				\end{itemize}

				This step will help you work out the structure of your literature review and (if applicable) show how your own research will contribute to existing knowledge.%
			}

		\section*{Outlining the Structure of the Literature Review}
			There are four (4) major principles of organization one may use in writing an effective Literature Review, and these are: Chronological Order or Order of Time, Spatial Order, Climactic Order or Order of Importance, and Topical Order \autocite{friedlanderPrinciplesOrganization2004}.
			\subsection{Chronological Order}
				\textquote[\cite{friedlanderPrinciplesOrganization2004}]{%
					Chronological order can suit different rhetorical modes or patterns of exposition.
					It naturally fits in narration, because when we tell a story, we usually follow the order in which events occur.
					Chronological order applies to process in the same way, because when we describe or explain how something happens or works, we usually follow the order in which the events occur.
					But chronological order may also apply to example, description, or parts of any other pattern of exposition.%
				}
			\subsection{Spatial Order}
				\textquote[\cite{friedlanderPrinciplesOrganization2004}]{%
					In this pattern, items are arranged according to their physical position or relationships.
					\dots
					In explaining some political or social problem, I might discuss first the concerns of the East Coast, then those of the Midwest, then those of the West Coast.
					Describing a person, I might start at the feet and move up to the head, or just the other way around.
					This pattern might use such transitions as just to the right, a little further on, to the south of Memphis, a few feet behind, in New Mexico, turning left on the pathway, and so on.%
				}
			\subsection{Climactic Order}
				\enquote{%
					In this pattern, items are arranged from least important to most important.
					Typical transitions would include \textit{more important}, \textit{most difficult}, \textit{still harder}, \textit{by far the most expensive}, \textit{even more damaging}, \textit{worse yet}, and so on.
					This is a flexible principle of organization, and may guide the organization of all or part of example, comparison \& contrast, cause \& effect, and description.

					A variation of climactic order is called psychological order.
					This pattern or organization grows from our learning that readers or listeners usually give most attention to what comes at the beginning and the end, and least attention to what is in the middle.
					In this pattern, then, you decide what is most important and put it at the beginning or the end; next you choose what is second most important and put it at the end or the beginning (whichever remains); the less important or powerful items are then arranged in the middle. If the order of importance followed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, with 5 being most important, psychological order might follow the order 4, 3, 1, 2, 5.

					Still other principles of organization based on emphasis include:
					\begin{itemize}
						\item general-to-specific order,
						\item specific-to general order,
						\item most-familiar-to-least-familiar,
						\item simplest-to-most-complex,
						\item order of frequency,
						\item order of familiarity, and so on.
					\end{itemize}%
				} This principle of organization is one of the most common. \autocite{friedlanderPrinciplesOrganization2004}
			\subsection{Order of Importance}
				\textquote[\cite{friedlanderPrinciplesOrganization2004}]{%
					[The Order of Importance] refers to organization that emerges from the topic itself.
					For example, a description of a computer might naturally involve the separate components of the central processing unit, the monitor, and the keyboard, while a discussion of a computer purchase might discuss needs, products, vendors, and service.
					A discussion of a business might explore product, customer, and location, and so on.
					Topical order, then, simply means an order that arises from the nature of the topic itself.
					Transitions in this pattern will be a little vague--things like \textit{another factor}, \textit{the second component}, \textit{in addition}, and so on.%
				}

		\section*{Writing the Literature Review}
			In writing a literature review, one must follow the general structure: introduction, main body, and then conclusion.
			In the introduction, the central problem of the research must be reiterated and a summary must be provided of the current academic context.
			Here the timeliness of the topic or the presence of a knowledge gap is highlighted.
			In the body, subheadings divide major parts that are highlighted in the outline.
			One must keep in mind the following ideas \autocite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019}:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item an overview of the main points of each source must be noted and combined into one coherent whole
				\item analyses and interpretations must be provided regarding the findings of each source with respect to the research
				\item the strengths and weaknesses of each source must be stated
				\item the topic sentence of each paragraph must be clear and the flow between paragraphs must be maintained with transitions
			\end{itemize}
			In the conclusion, the key findings of each related literature should be summarized with emphasis on their significance to the research \autocite{mccombesLiteratureReviewComplete2019}.

	\chapter{MATERIALS AND METHODS}
		\section{Research Design}
			% TODO: Research Design
			\textcite{labareeTypesResearchDesigns2020} states: \textquote[][.]{The function of a research design is to ensure that the evidence obtained enables you to effectively address the research problem logically and as unambiguously as possible}.
			You may use the article by \textcite{labareeTypesResearchDesigns2020} to figure out which research design will suit your study the best.
			In this section of the paper, the research design is described, as well as the independent and dependent variables involved.
			The description of how identified extraneous variables are held constant is also elaborated in the Research Design section.
			If the study is developmental in nature, the stages of development may be stated in this section.

		\section{Locale of the Study}
			% TODO: Locale of the Study
			The places where the study is executed should be stated in the Locale of the Study.
			The population where samples are taken, as well as the sample size, should be mentioned here.
			This section must also contain the reasoning for choosing the locale, with respect to the scope and limitations of the study.

		\section{Materials and Research Instruments}
			% TODO: Materials and Research Instruments
			The materials required in the study as well as any instrumentation to be used should be mentioned in the Materials and Research Instruments.
			The reasoning may involve any past researches or research-based handbooks that are relevant to the study and are published works (as published works tend to be peer-reviewed).
			An example of a research-based handbook is \textcite{letcherWindEnergyEngineering2017}.

		\section{Procedures}
			% TODO: Procedures
			An elaborate and chronological description of the procedures to be taken is provided in this section.
			The proper reasoning for each step taken should be stated, as well as what materials and research instruments are used in each step.

			\subsection{Analysis of Data}
				The statistical tools as well as the significance level to be used is mentioned in this portion of the paper.
				How the statistical tools will be used should also be detailed in this section.


	\chapter{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}
		% TODO: Results and Discussion
		\textquote[\cite{skillsyouneed.comDissertationWritingResults2020}]{The Results section should set out your key experimental results, including any statistical analysis and whether or not the results of these are significant}.

		Cite literature that support your analyses of the results.
		It is imperative to include relevant results, regardless of support of hypotheses.
		Brief descriptions of the results should be provided when clarification is needed.
